# Multithreaded-Task-Scheduler
This repository houses a C++ implementation of a Task Scheduler, leveraging threads to facilitate concurrent task execution. It provides a foundational framework for scheduling and executing tasks in a multi-threaded environment, demonstrating the effective use of threads, mutexes, and condition variables in C++.

## Features
Task Creation and Execution: Define tasks with specific functionalities that can be executed concurrently.
Dynamic Task Scheduling: Tasks are queued and scheduled dynamically across multiple threads for execution.
Thread Pool Management: Utilizes a pool of threads to execute tasks concurrently, optimizing resource use and execution time.
Concurrency Control: Ensures thread safety through mutexes and condition variables, managing access to the task queue.

## Getting Started
### File Structure
task.hpp/cpp: Defines the Task class for task creation and management.
TaskScheduler.hpp/cpp: Implements the Task Scheduler, managing the task queue and thread pool.
main.cpp: Demonstrates the usage of the Task Scheduler with example tasks.
compile.sh: A shell script to compile the project using g++ and link the necessary files.

### Compilation and Execution
Compile the Project:

Use the provided compile.sh script to compile the project. This script compiles main.cpp, task.cpp, and TaskScheduler.cpp with the -lpthread flag to enable POSIX threading support.

./compile.sh
Run the Executable:

After compilation, run the generated executable to start the task scheduler and execute the tasks:

./Executable

## Implementation Note
Ensure that task.hpp/cpp, TaskScheduler.hpp/cpp, and your main.cpp are in the same directory. The TaskScheduler relies on the functionality provided by task.hpp/cpp for task management.
The Task class is designed to be extended for specific tasks. Each task must implement the execute() method, defining the task's behavior.
The TaskScheduler class manages a pool of worker threads that execute tasks from a queue. It demonstrates basic concurrency control mechanisms, such as mutexes and condition variables, to safely manage access to the shared task queue.

## Usage
To use the Task Scheduler in your project, define your tasks by extending the Task class and implementing the execute() method. Add tasks to the scheduler using addTask(std::unique_ptr<Task> task). The scheduler automatically handles the execution of tasks across its thread pool.
